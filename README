C4-0 POWER SUPPLY FIRMWARE
==========================

The microcontroller on the C4-0 power supply provides very basic control and
supervisory functions, as well as a waveform generator for the sync phase
signals.

Generates four sync signals with phase relationships as shown:

                 ___     ___
SYNC_P3A    \___/   \___/       f ~= 600kHz
             ___     ___
SYNC_P3B    /   \___/   \___
             ___     ___
SYNC_P5A    /   \___/   \___
                 ___     ___
SYNC_P5B    \___/   \___/


Standby mode
------------

When in standby (the default at power-on, and subsequently when placed in that
mode via the debug or control ports):

    - MCU power consumption is reduced. High-speed oscillator shut down,
      CPU in sleep until data arrives at an interface.

    - SYNC_P3B is solidly asserted (no clock), and the other three SYNC_*
      signals as well as N12_EN are deasserted. This enables one 3.3V
      regulator to provide standby power.

    - In the first 100ms after enabling P3B, P3B_PG (power good) must settle
      to the 'good' state. If it does not, the regulator will be disabled, and
      the 'SFY'* and '3VB' LEDs lit to indicate the error.

    - 100ms after P3B_PG settles, a supervisory state is entered where any
      change in power-good status will again disable the regulator and trigger
      the 'SFY' and '3VB' LEDs.


Full-power mode
---------------

After being switched to full-power mode:

    - High-speed oscillator is spun up to 32 MHz to allow accurate generation
      of timing signals.

    - P3B defaults to enabled; the other three buck converters and the
      inverting converter default to disabled.

    - The SYNC output for each buck regulator shall be the logical AND of its
      synchronization clock signal and its enable status.

    - The inverting regulator shares a synchronization signal with 3VB.

    - Enabling the N12 regulator will be delayed until 100ms after
      power-good status is received for (3VB && (5VA || 5VB)). If N12 is
      enabled but its parent supplies have not come up yet, this is considered
      a power-bad state.

    - In the first 100ms after enabling any supply (including N12), its
      respective PG (power good) signal must settle to the 'good' state. If
      it does not, the regulator will be disabled, and the 'SFY' LED and
      per-supply LED will light to indicate the error.

    - 100ms after PG settles, that supply enters a supervisory state where
      any change in power-good status will disable all regulators and trigger
      the 'SFY' and per-supply LEDs.


* SFY = Shit's Fucked, Yo.
